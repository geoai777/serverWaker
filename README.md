# serverWaker

A script that uses wake on lan program to wake server, and then mount network share

## USAGE
To start using script you should edit following two lines:
```
set ipMan=**your ip here**
set srvMac=**server mac here**
```

In my case I used [this](https://wol.aquilatech.com/) wake on lan soft. I guess any other can be used.
